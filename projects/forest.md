Python package to estimate the above-ground biomass carbon in forests using drone data. 

For this project, I researched and evaluated different geostatistical interpolation methods, such as
kriging, inverse distance weighting, and nearest-neighbors. I implemented an ordinary kriging model 
to recover a hidden map of forest density using noisy and incomplete data. I also researched and 
implemented an allometric model for estimating above-ground biomass carbon in individual trees.
