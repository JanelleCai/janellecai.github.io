Understanding climate policy using NLP.

In this project, I conducted research to connect text spans from the Nationally Determined Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. Using this, we can better understand progress toward climate goals and shifts in priorities between different documents. 

I worked on this under the guidance of Daniel Spokoyny, Dr. Tom Corringham, and Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick from UC San Diego.
