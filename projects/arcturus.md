ROS2 autonomy stack for Arcturus's autonomous surface vehicle, Fish n' Ships.

These are some of the projects that I've worked on for the team.
- A color segmentation algorithm for object detection using Python and OpenCV
- A stationkeeping mission in [MOOS-IvP](https://oceanai.mit.edu/moos-ivp/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) that integrates PID and odometry, written in C++
- Enhancing the simulation environment for testing our vehicle's autonomous capabilities
- Mentoring team members on ROS2, Linux/Ubuntu, and git
