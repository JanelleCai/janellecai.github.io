Full-stack web application for book enthusiasts to connect.

Users can create their own profile to track their reading progress, favorite genres, books they've 
read, are currently reading, or want to read. Users can also friend others and create a blend 
with them to see how many books they have in common or view joint reading statistics. 

Built with [@christykl](https://github.com/christykl) and [@gsrhaecnige](https://github.com/gsrhaecnige)
