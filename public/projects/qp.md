Planning algorithms for distributed control of multi-agent robotic systems.

In this research project, I studied quadratic programming and barrier function based controllers for 
multi-agent systems and planning algorithms to avoid deadlock. 
I derived a controller for a multi-agent system with general dynamics and implemented this controller in JAX. 
The controller models obstacle and collision avoidance, maintaining communication and connectivity, and goal-reaching behaviors. 

I worked on this project under the guidance of Kunal Garg in the [Reliable Autonomous Systems Lab at MIT](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/realm/).
